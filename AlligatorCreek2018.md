# Alligator Creek - 28 to 29 July, 2018

This was my first ever hike into the Australian wilderness and I really enjoyed it. The hike we did was very dense in shrubbery and the terrain was very variable with some areas being flat, whilst others tended to be hilly and uneven. The environment is very quiet with not a lot of sounds, I compared it to the scenes in Jurassic Park, where there also is dense bush and a whole lot of nothing. The quietness was what I would imagine being on a different plant, such as Mars, would be like.

## Journey details

### Location

Bowling Green Bay National Park is a 25km drive south of Townsville via Bruce Highway, with a final turn Alligator Creek Road leading to the Alligator Creek camping and day-use areas. All in all this incurs about 30 minutes on the road. The track we travelled along was quite mountainous in parts and featured many shallow creek crossings as well as a much deeper crossing, which prompted the team to create a makeshift raft out of sticks and rope.

Here is the whole group tying snake and reef knots securing the sticks that we found together into the hull of a mighty ship! If only it had floated, we ended up using the raft as a way of carrying a singular bag on the shoulders of four people. Below is one of our many voyages over the creek, the water got well above my waist at the deepest part, as evident by my clothes.

The track acts as an access corrider for a transmission line, with one part following these high voltage wires which stretch far beyond the horizon line.

The major part of this hike was seeing Alligator Creek Falls, which can be seen from afar in the below photo (look at the clearing in the trees, the rocky outcrop is the Falls!).

These are the glorious Alligator Creek Falls, up close and personal.

Finally here is everyone having fun (and me freezing, since the water was quite cold)!

### Map

The route we took covered a lot of area, all the way from the campsite and day area to Alligator Creek Falls. The map below showcases all the waypoints recorded along the journey, with the top left being the campsite and day area and the bottom right being the location of Alligator Creek Falls. The white lines correlate to the transmission lines we saw. You can access this map [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ezpSHgLPYgO7Axf5CQmAoAjNjCYvcI_r&usp=sharing), theres some waypoint names and images as well at that link!

Next time I want to record all of this in Strava, so I can get a much more accurate map of everything.

## Journey equipment loadout

### Equipment

The equipment I took in my pack consisted something of this,

- 1 x bag full of clothes

- 1 x extra pair of shoes 

- 1 x drawstring bag full of food

- 1 x sleeping bag

- 1 x self inflating mat

- 1 x sleeping bag liner

- 1 x bug repellent 

- 1 x sunscreen

- 1 x cooking pots and accessories

- 1 x gas burner

In the end I could heavily cut down on the clothes I bought, all I need *really* are pyjamas and maybe something to keep me warm depending on the climate. Also, I doubt I will ever need spare shoes, I think it was a miracle I brought it on this trip as my original shoes did get wholly inundated at the creek crossing. 

As for the weight of my pack, I think it did end up tipping the scales at around 15 kilograms, but I did find that quite easy and comfortable! However, I did have some minor back and shoulder pain on the night that we spent at the campsite but that cleared up the next day.

### Food

The food contained within the drawstring bag full of food contained too much unnecessary food articles such as snacks. My portion sizes were not that bad, this meant I didn't bring back a lot of food from my preplanned meals such as dinner and breakfast. My plan of attack next time is to consolidate my snacks into one bag of trail mix, and take just that convenient bag instead of a million. 

Also next time I probably will document all my equipment with photos, maybe with all of it laid out on the floor in order to see what I'm taking.
