### Map/Route Plan

All in all the route was a literal "uphill battle" in some areas with ups and downs ranging from mediocre to dramatic. The track was so extremely dense with vegetation and trees, that navigating along trails became almost impossible without a map and compass. It was also common to lose bearing of the direction of the track due to the disorienting nature of the environment.

The route the group followed was approximately 8 kilometres one way and the essentially the same back – the party took a different, but similar in length, route on the way out. The final route the group hiked along went from Paluma Dam to Johnstone's Clearing whilst intersecting with some "sight-seeing" sites such as Crystal Creek Falls,

The Adventurous Journey party managed to navigate to Johnstone's Clearing and back to Paluma Dam in a little under 10 hours, with approximately half of this time being devoted to "moving time", whilst the other was spent resting or stopped on the trail.

Below is the map of the group's journey, it consists of waypoints recorded from the GPS device superimposed onto a map of the area.

### Equipment List

| List                     | Review and Description of Items                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Accessory bag            | This very large ziplock bag contained a writing pad as well as stationary, a pocket knife, sunscreen, various repair kits, bug repellent and toiletries. One minor improvent would be the consideration of the the size of ziplock bag, other than this there was no other room for improvement in regards to this item.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Drawstring bag of food   | The food was physically really large and difficult to compact, since food items would get crushed. However there was just enough space for the bag at the top of my pack. One major flaw was my drawstring bag ripping along a seam, which was quickly fixed by some cloth tape supplied by a team member. Thus it might be useful to bring cloth tape for any further journeys.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Clothes                  | Consisting of pyjamas, a swimming outfit, a jacket, a raincoat and a spare pair of socks. There are three points of review as far as clothing is concerned, pertaining to the swimming outfit, raincoat and socks. First, the swimming outfit could be replaced with another set of hiking clothes, or wholly excluded with any wet clothes being dried overnight. Secondly, the raincoat can be removed as, usually, it never rains and it is possible to survive in rain without a raincoat. Finally, the socks were an unnecessary addition and should be removed for future journeys. |
| Bowl and eating utensils | The bowl and eating utensils could not be further improved. However the addition of a fork (for eating) and metal spoon (for cooking) proved a good idea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| First aid kit            | The first aid kit was not used, however when the need for iodine and a bandaid arose, I was attended to by another member of the group. However, it should be noted that this first aid kit contains both iodine and bandaids. Although, a useful addition to the first aid kit would be iodine wipes instead of the liquid, which tends to be messy and difficult to apply to wounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Ground tarp              | This ground tarp was used and worked as intended. But, it does take up quite a lot of space in a pack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Inflatable mat           | The mat self inflates and works well when used properly. Similarly to the ground tarp, the mat takes quite a lot of space in a pack and is difficult to re-roll after being deployed and inflated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Sleeping bag and liner   | I invested in a much smaller sleeping bag, it is much smaller than my previous one, however, it and the liner are extremely difficult to repack after being deployed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Below is a picture of all the above listed gear right before I packed it into my hiking bag.

| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Jacket              | This jacket is quite thick, and it definitely did not get as cold as I was expecting. Thus, a thinner jacket would be beneficial. Moreover, a thinner jacket would also equate to less weight and having a light pack is an advantage.                                                                                                                                             |
| Pyjamas             | The pyjamas have long sleeves and long legs which are necessary when doing the dishes in the bush.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Raincoat            | It did not rain and the raincoat was unnecessary and should be excluded from any future packs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Spare pair of socks | Similarly to the raincoat, the spare pair of socks was more of a "luxury" and was unnecessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Swimming outfit     | The swimming outfit, in my opinion, is necessary. The only other alternative would be to bring a spare pair of hiking clothes, which would be more of a hassle then bringing a swimming outfit. Alternatively, I could swim in my hiking clothes, hike wet until I reached camp and dry my clothes  over night. Ultimately, I think bringing a swimming outfit is the best option. |

| The full food and utensil list can be found [here](https://riversharp4.github.io/DukeOfEdinburgh/DukeofEdAJFood.pdf). | For this trip the food was well planned as well as well executed. Making food "from scratch" at a campsite is definitely gratifying. All in all we made dinner, dessert, breakfast and lunch "from scratch" for two from the supplies we carried in. One critique from dinner was the amount of time cooking the pasta took, which was really unreasonable. Other than this critique there was no other problems or issues with our food plan. Also this time around I consolidated all my snacks into a single bag of trail mix which was handy and worked really well. |

### Description of Journey

#### Day 1

We were driven all the way from Kirwan State High School to Paluma Dam in the morning. Paluma Dam is very extensive and large, supplying water to the township of Paluma. This was the starting point of our hike.

![5c35dde1424f4](https://i.loli.net/2019/01/09/5c35dde1424f4.jpg)

After we crossed the Dam wall and got onto the trail it became quite apparent that the terrain was much more different from the Alligator Creek Adventurous Journey.

![5c36b26403ec2](https://i.loli.net/2019/01/10/5c36b26403ec2.jpg)

Here is me next to a very large log that was uprooted and fell down over the middle of the trail and since then has been cut with a chainsaw in order to accomodate for hikers walking along the trail.

![5c36b4cda7e0a](https://i.loli.net/2019/01/10/5c36b4cda7e0a.jpg)

Next was Marker 29,

![5c36ba18670b4](https://i.loli.net/2019/01/10/5c36ba18670b4.jpg)

followed by this warning sign, which is meant to deter amateur hikers who are less than prepared for what is ahead. To be clear there was nothing major on the trail, but one should be prepared with a compass, map, GPS, first aid kit and EPIRB for a start. 

![5c36bb255e5ca](https://i.loli.net/2019/01/10/5c36bb255e5ca.jpg)

From Marker 29 we went toward Marker 30, and turned toward Marker 31, Torsten's Rock Gardens and Wilfred's Lookout.

![5c36bc88bead9](https://i.loli.net/2019/01/10/5c36bc88bead9.jpg)

There are some photo's of Wilfred's Lookout and Torsten's Rock Gardens above, but here is another snap of the Lookout. The view is very scenic and beautiful, the horizon is only obstructed by hills in the area.

![5c36bd0baea83](https://i.loli.net/2019/01/10/5c36bd0baea83.jpg)

From the Lookout, it was off to Torsten's Rock Gardens or Marker 32,

![5c36bd634c49c](https://i.loli.net/2019/01/10/5c36bd634c49c.jpg)

the rock formations and large trees here were quite spectacular and we even saw a bat! The group was headed toward Crystal Creek Falls, thus we went in the direction of Marker 33. The trail from 32 to 33 starts of extremely steep downwards, and there is a lot of elevation lost.

![5c36be4af1eab](https://i.loli.net/2019/01/10/5c36be4af1eab.jpg)

These Marker are metal discs on the top of a metal rod which is dug into the ground and disks themselves lie horizontal and face the sky. The face of the Marker has compass degree markings which are immensely helpful when navigating the trail with a compass, and the number of the next Marker that should appear. From 33 it was off to 34 and the majestic Crystal Creek Falls.

![5c36bef71f6f9](https://i.loli.net/2019/01/10/5c36bef71f6f9.jpg)

Did I mention how gorgeous Crystal Creek Falls is? It is quite a sight to behold, and a definite highlight of the trip and it is impossible to sum it up in one photo.

![5c36c011d19f8](https://i.loli.net/2019/01/10/5c36c011d19f8.jpg)

The area of Crystal Creek Falls we stumbled across was very high, and had a downward slope that was completely dry and devoid of water, which meant we could go to the "cliff area" where the falls actually spilled over. At the very top of this area was an extremely cold pool of water, this is where we had a little swim and refilled our water reserviors. The rock in this area was exposed and looked either sedimentary or igneous.

![5c36c064e3034](https://i.loli.net/2019/01/10/5c36c064e3034.jpg)

I grazed my knee here, trying to recklessly climb up a tiny ledge – lucky a team members had her first aid kit handy. Then we hiked in our swimming kits all the way to Johnstone's Clearing, past Marker 28.

![5c36c143ec5ed](https://i.loli.net/2019/01/10/5c36c143ec5ed.jpg)

There was a creek crossing, where a rope strung between two trees on either bank of the creek was the only thing to hold onto. It was a real test of agility, and I recall asking one of the teachers,

"What's the plan?"

"To not step in the water", replied the teacher.

I thought this was quite hilarious.

![5c36c202a52c0](https://i.loli.net/2019/01/10/5c36c202a52c0.jpg)

Finally after a little more hiking, we finally reached our campsite – Johnstone's Clearing. Here is a very blurry picture of a incredibly relieved hiking party reaching camp.

![5c36c2d9c3985](https://i.loli.net/2019/01/10/5c36c2d9c3985.jpg)

And here is the Marker for Johnstone's Clearing.

![5c36c7ce6d3a7](https://i.loli.net/2019/01/10/5c36c7ce6d3a7.jpg)

After we reached our goal and destination we set up camp, collected wood for a campfire and got into our pyjamas. The campfire was very nice and one of the teachers bought some different coloured firelighters which made our campfire all sorts of different colours. Our dinner for Day 1 was penne with tomato pasta sauce, salami and cheese as well as oregano sprinkled on top. The pasta took forever to cook, but it was an amazing meal, and non of the pasta went to waste. Next was dessert – a campfire banana split with marshmallows, chocolate chips and biscuits. Dessert was equally as amazing and all in all dinner was well done and cooked "from scratch". We did the dishes (easily my favourite part of camping) and hung our food out of the reaches of the native wildlife. Then it was lights out, I stayed up a little to marvel at the sky which was devoid of any light pollution, and then I went to sleep along with the rest of the camp.



#### Day 2

The next day I was awoken to a symphony of birds calling, I could not believe how loud it was! I was the first awake at the camp and started my day by packing up my gear into its bags and cases, which is usually a timely endeavour. After everyone (including me) fully "woke up", we made breakfast! One of the teachers stated that,

"Camp oats are always the best",

and I agree with her. The oats we made were really delicious, we even added apple and some blueberries. The portions were just the right amount as well, which was definitely a plus.

![5c36c762d64e0](https://i.loli.net/2019/01/10/5c36c762d64e0.jpg)

After breakfast, we prepared lunch for Day 2 and set off, leaving Johnstone's Clearing behind. We did not go the way we came from, rather we did a bit of a detour so we could see more of the area. Before long we reached Marker 13, with the direction for Johnstone's Clearing indicated on the Marker face.

![5c36c891bfdf1](https://i.loli.net/2019/01/10/5c36c891bfdf1.jpg)

Here is a photo of the dense foilage and terrain we faced along the trail,

![5c36c91341e48](https://i.loli.net/2019/01/10/5c36c91341e48.jpg)

as well as a refridgerator tree. Which is a tree that is distinctly red and stands out against the green background of the foilage and bush. The major "wow factor" of this tree comes from the fact that when you feel the tree, it is abnormally cold – like a refridgerator.

![5c36c9b25e766](https://i.loli.net/2019/01/10/5c36c9b25e766.jpg)

We found our way to the DCK shelter, 

![5c36cc448c2f9](https://i.loli.net/2019/01/10/5c36cc448c2f9.jpg)

which is a picturesque, little and cozy hut that is available to be rented by hiking parties like us. It is like a motel for hikers, the hut even has a guest book full of happy hiker's comments! 

![5c36cafd8998e](https://i.loli.net/2019/01/10/5c36cafd8998e.jpg)

There is a large water reservoir next to it, this is where we refilled our water supplies.

![5c36caa9ab7ea](https://i.loli.net/2019/01/10/5c36caa9ab7ea.jpg)

There were also some historic abandoned mines around the area, it is important to stay on trail in areas like this as it is common for hikers to fall down mines. 

![5c36cca7e5e74](https://i.loli.net/2019/01/10/5c36cca7e5e74.jpg)

After this detour we joined the main trail that was our way in and we hiked along this until we reached Paluma Dam.

![5c36cce00230c](https://i.loli.net/2019/01/10/5c36cce00230c.jpg)

This was the final reading on the GPS I was operating,

![5c36cd107a32b](https://i.loli.net/2019/01/10/5c36cd107a32b.jpg)

and this is the party finally leaving the bush whilst entering civilization.

![5c36cd67d1d0d](https://i.loli.net/2019/01/10/5c36cd67d1d0d.jpg)

Finally we cooled off on the causeway as the group waited for our ride back to Kirwan State High School.

![5c36cded9473e](https://i.loli.net/2019/01/10/5c36cded9473e.jpg)

And yes, those are clouds.

### Thoughts and Reflections

All this hiking through dense jungle really makes you feel like an explorer. It puts into perspective the people who have devoted their life to the trail. This includes early explorers from colonial Australia to people who do it to this day. I really enjoy the eerie quietness of it and the different sounds that echo through the bush. 

All in all, I thought that we prepared well and we executed well. Ultimately, it was an enjoyable trip and I can't wait till we go again on another Journey.
