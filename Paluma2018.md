### Map/Route Plan

All in all the route was a literal "uphill battle" in some areas with ups and downs ranging from mediocre to dramatic. The track was so extremely dense with vegetation and trees, that navigating along trails became almost impossible without a map and compass. It was also common to lose bearing of the direction of the track due to the disorienting nature of the environment.

The route the group followed was approximately 8 kilometres one way and the essentially the same back – the party took a different, but similar in length, route on the way out. The final route the group hiked along went from Paluma Dam to Johnstone's Clearing whilst intersecting with some "sight-seeing" sites such as Crystal Creek Falls,

The Adventurous Journey party managed to navigate to Johnstone's Clearing and back to Paluma Dam in a little under 10 hours, with approximately half of this time being devoted to "moving time", whilst the other was spent resting or stopped on the trail.

Below is the map of the group's journey, it consists of waypoints recorded from the GPS device superimposed onto a map of the area.

| List                     | Review and Description of Items                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Accessory bag            | This very large ziplock bag contained a writing pad as well as stationary, a pocket knife, sunscreen, various repair kits, bug repellent and toiletries. One minor improvent would be the consideration of the the size of ziplock bag, other than this there was no other room for improvement in regards to this item.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Drawstring bag of food   | The food was physically really large and difficult to compact, since food items would get crushed. However there was just enough space for the bag at the top of my pack. One major flaw was my drawstring bag ripping along a seam, which was quickly fixed by some cloth tape supplied by a team member. Thus it might be useful to bring cloth tape for any further journeys.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Clothes                  | Consisting of pyjamas, a swimming outfit, a jacket, a raincoat and a spare pair of socks. There are three points of review as far as clothing is concerned, pertaining to the swimming outfit, raincoat and socks. First, the swimming outfit could be replaced with another set of hiking clothes, or wholly excluded with any wet clothes being dried overnight. Secondly, the raincoat can be removed as, usually, it never rains and it is possible to survive in rain without a raincoat. Finally, the socks were an unnecessary addition and should be removed for future journeys. |
| Bowl and eating utensils | The bowl and eating utensils could not be further improved. However the addition of a fork (for eating) and metal spoon (for cooking) proved a good idea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| First aid kit            | The first aid kit was not used, however when the need for iodine and a bandaid arose, I was attended to by another member of the group. However, it should be noted that this first aid kit contains both iodine and bandaids. Although, a useful addition to the first aid kit would be iodine wipes instead of the liquid, which tends to be messy and difficult to apply to wounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Ground tarp              | This ground tarp was used and worked as intended. But, it does take up quite a lot of space in a pack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Inflatable mat           | The mat self inflates and works well when used properly. Similarly to the ground tarp, the mat takes quite a lot of space in a pack and is difficult to re-roll after being deployed and inflated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Sleeping bag and liner   | I invested in a much smaller sleeping bag, it is much smaller than my previous one, however, it and the liner are extremely difficult to repack after being deployed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Below is a picture of all the above listed gear right before I packed it into my hiking bag.

| List                | Review and Description of Items                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Jacket              | This jacket is quite thick, and it definitely did not get as cold as I was expecting. Thus, a thinner jacket would be beneficial. Moreover, a thinner jacket would also equate to less weight and having a light pack is an advantage.                                                                                                                                             |
| Pyjamas             | The pyjamas have long sleeves and long legs which are necessary when doing the dishes in the bush.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Raincoat            | It did not rain and the raincoat was unnecessary and should be excluded from any future packs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Spare pair of socks | Similarly to the raincoat, the spare pair of socks was more of a "luxury" and was unnecessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Swimming outfit     | The swimming outfit, in my opinion, is necessary. The only other alternative would be to bring a spare pair of hiking clothes, which would be more of a hassle then bringing a swimming outfit. Alternatively, I could swim in my hiking clothes, hike wet until I reached camp and dry my clothes  over night. Ultimately, I think bringing a swimming outfit is the best option. |
